# In order to configure A typescript project, you have to initialize a typescript project:-
=> tsc --init 
Then change the rootDir and outDir in the tsconfig.json file in order to set up the source (typescript) and output (javascript) files 

# To run all the typescript files:-
=> tsc

3 To run all the typescript files and watch them, use:-
=> tsc --watch

# We can add the "include" property at the semi-end of the tsconfig.json file and give it an array of which folders to look for sorce typescript files
=> example:- "include": ["src"]
